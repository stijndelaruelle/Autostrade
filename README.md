# Hatch This!

Can you outrun all the other cars and hatch your egg in time?
Or are you getting scrambled, cracked or boiled in the process?

Find out in this small "turn-based racing game", where the cars only move when you move!

Play it in [itch.io](https://kapistijn.itch.io/hatch-this)!

## Gameplay tip

You can move towards the side of the road (any direction) to make the cars move while you don't!

## Technical

This is a game made with Bitsy by Adam Le Doux.

It contains a whopping 48.210 lines of Bitsy data, 330 rooms, 205 tiles, 16 sprites and 5182 endings.
No Bitsy "hacks" were used.

Mostly structured by a custom tool written for the project, but also partially painstakingly copied and pasted.
It was one hell of a job, believe me.

## Story time!

When I was a bit younger I used to "sit on an egg" all of the time, and most of the time even multiple at once.
Meaning: "If I even got the chance to build my dream game, it would be one of these!" (Dream game being the egg.)

Now I'm a bit older, I don't have that anymore. Which saddens me.
Everytime I think of a project now, I think of it in how long it would take and all the other inconviencinces that creating a "dream project" brings.

With this project I wanted to bring back that childish naivety that didn't care about all those things.

My first computer game ever I made with my brother in Powerpoint, it had over a hundred slides all linked together just to move a character.
In the end it was a complete mess to work in, but we loved every minute of making it.
Not stopping when we realised it was "going to be too much work". (Time was never a factor.)

So here it is, a project I spend way too much time on.
Embodying the spirit of creating without concern!

Enjoy!
